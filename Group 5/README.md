**Group 5 - CQU AI Project**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

How might we utilize AI and robotics to minimize grocery shopping mentally and physically taxing for elderly people in Chongqing?

## 🚀 Project Overview

A smart cart robot with built-in AI to help recommend and predict products for elderly customers, using face and voice recognition to trigger robot functionality and register users. The system provides personalized shopping assistance to make grocery shopping easier and more accessible for elderly people.

## 🤖 AI Features

### For New Users (No Shopping History)

- **Essential Health Items**: Suggests products specifically beneficial for elderly health (high calcium, fiber, omega-3)
- **Budget-friendly Options**: Provides affordable recommendations for customers on fixed incomes

### For Recurring Users (With Shopping History)
- **Content-based Recommendation**: Analyzes product features (nutrition, price, category) to suggest relevant items
- **Predictive Shopping**: Predicts items users would want based on previous purchases
- **Healthier Alternatives**: Recommends products with similar categories but better nutritional content, prices, or relevance
- **Personalized Analytics**: Tracks shopping patterns and provides health insights

## 📊 Data Structure

### Customer Data
- Face encodings for recognition
- Shopping history with timestamps
- Personal preferences and dietary requirements
- Category preferences based on purchase patterns

### Product Data
- Comprehensive product information (name, category, price, brand)
- Detailed nutritional content (calories, protein, sugar, fiber, vitamins, minerals)
- Monthly sales data for popularity analysis
- Health scores based on nutritional profiles

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**
```bash
cd "Group 5"
```

2. **Install required dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Install face recognition dependencies** (if needed)
```bash
# On Windows - may require Visual Studio Build Tools
pip install dlib
pip install face-recognition

# On Linux/Mac
sudo apt-get install cmake
pip install dlib face-recognition
```

4. **Run the demo**
```bash
python demo.py
```

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Running the Demo

The system includes an interactive demonstration script that showcases all features:

```bash
python demo.py
```

The demo offers multiple scenarios:
1. **New Customer Experience** - Shows popularity-based recommendations
2. **Returning Customer Experience** - Demonstrates personalized recommendations
3. **System Features Overview** - Displays analytics and system capabilities
4. **Run All Demos** - Complete system walkthrough

### Using the Recommendation Engine

```python
from src.recommendation_engine import SmartCartRecommendationEngine

# Initialize the system
engine = SmartCartRecommendationEngine()

# Start a customer session
customer_id = engine.start_customer_session(use_camera=True)

# Get recommendations
recommendations = engine.get_recommendations(recommendation_type="mixed")

# Process voice commands
voice_result = engine.process_voice_command()

# Add items to cart
cart_result = engine.add_to_cart(["P001", "P002", "P003"])

# End session
engine.end_session()
```

### Face Recognition

```python
from src.face_recognition_service import FaceRecognitionService
from src.customer_manager import CustomerManager

customer_manager = CustomerManager()
face_service = FaceRecognitionService(customer_manager)

# Interactive recognition
customer_id = face_service.interactive_customer_recognition()

# Register new customer
new_customer_id = face_service.register_new_customer(face_image, "Customer Name")
```
